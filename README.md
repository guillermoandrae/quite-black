A Hacktoberfest project celebrating blackness.

## Why?
Why not?

## OK. So what now?
Just about anything goes. The site is hosted on S3, so there's no need for an application server. The HTML is simple, the CSS isn't complex, and the JavaScript leaves a lot to be desired. I've left a lot of room for you all to do great things.

## Contributing
I'll be accepting quotes, either about blackness or spoken/written by black folks, as long as they aren't vulgar or profane. Have a look at the contributing guidelines before you open a PR. 

Let's goooooooooo!
